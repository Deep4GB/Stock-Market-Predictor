# Stock Price Predictor

## Project Overview

Stock Price Predictor is a project aimed at predicting stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks and machine learning techniques. The project provides two types of visualizations: one through a Jupyter Notebook and another through a web application created with Flask. These visualizations allow users to explore the stock price prediction model and observe the results using tables and charts.

# 

## Jupyter Notebook Visualization

### Prerequisites

To run the Jupyter Notebook visualization, you need to have Python installed. The required libraries can be installed using the `requirements.txt` file.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Open and run the Jupyter Notebook, which provides a step-by-step breakdown of the project, including data collection, preprocessing, model training, prediction, and data visualization.

# 

## Flask Web Application Visualization

### Prerequisites
To run the Flask web application, you need to have Python installed. The required libraries can be installed using the requirements.txt file.

1. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python3 app.py
   ```
3. Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 to access the web application.

# 

## Usage

### Jupyter Notebook Visualization
1. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook, which will guide you through the process of stock price prediction using LSTM models.
2. Explore the step-by-step code cells to understand data collection, preprocessing, model training, and predictions.
3. Observe the results through data tables and visual charts.

### Flask Web Application Visualization
1. Run the Flask application using the steps mentioned above.
2. Access the web application through your web browser.
3. Enter a stock ticker symbol and click "Predict" to view the predicted stock price.
4. Observe the predicted price and a chart representing the predicted and actual prices.
